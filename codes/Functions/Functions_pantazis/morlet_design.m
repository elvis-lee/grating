% function morlet_design(fc,FWHM_tc)
%
% Plots the complex Morlet wavelet and its temporal and frequency resolution
% for a set of frequencies. 
%
% The complex Morlet wavelet is a Gaussian weighted sinusoid, blue for real values,
% red for imaginary values. The wavelet has temporal and frequency resolution
% weighted by Gaussian kernels. Two standard deviations are defined to be the resolution in
% either dimension. 
%
% INPUTS:
%   fc: central frequency
%   FWHM_tc: full width half maximum of Gaussian kernel (in time) at the central
%   frequency. Decreasing FWHM_tc improves temporal resolution (because
%   the wavelet has smaller temporal extent) at the expense of frequency
%   resolution
%
% Example values:
%  fc = 1;
%  FWHM_tc = 3;
%  morlet_design(fc,FWHM_tc);
